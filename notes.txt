Part 1. (8:40am - 9:40am)
    - Build a calculator
    - Handle (), +, -, *, / operations
    - Rules: () then * / then + -
    - Brainstorming:
        . Input: (5+8/2)*3/8+3 as a string. May have space inbetween
        . Create an empty list of operations
        . Create an empty list of numbers
        . Traverse through the string
            - If char is operation -> Add to Op.
            - If char is num
                . If prev char is * or / -> Evaluate right away
                . Else -> Add to N
            - If char is a ) -> Evaluate right away, then add result to N
        . O_list = (, +, /, ), *, /, +

Part 2. (9:50am - 11:10am)
    - Input: a number, e.g. 59249 or 1392 or 923731
    - Output: a largest number that is < input, whose digits are in asc order
    - Brainstorming:
        . Traverse through the digits
        . Let reduced = False
        . if dig[i] > dig[i+1]
            . dig[i] = dig[i] - 1
            . The rest of the digits = 9

Part 3. (11:15am - 12:40pm)
    - Graph a line, e.g. y = (5 + x/2)*3/8+3
    - Get a dataset:
        . For a range of x, get its y value
        . Use it to plot points, then connect them
